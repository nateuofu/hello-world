# hello-world
Coding sounds like it could be a good career. I have worked a lot of years in the HVAC controls world. I see the results of other people's coding and would like to develop some of my own code to make ideas I have a reality.
I found free code camp through KSL.com. They did a story on the free code camp and it looked like something I could really enjoy doing.
